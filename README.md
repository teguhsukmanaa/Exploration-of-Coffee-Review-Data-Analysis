## Introduction
In this project, I conducted a simple exploratory data analysis on a dataset that comprises coffee ratings and reviews from various countries spanning 2017 to 2022. The goal of this project is to identify the factors that influence coffee ratings based on their correlation. This will be achieved by examining the coffee ratings/trends within a certain period of time based on available datasets. The analysis, which will be conducted within a month, can lead the company to its goal for maximizing profitability in effectively capturing consumer preferences by choosing the right coffee products to use.

## Dataset
The coffee ratings and reviews dataset utilized was sourced from the [Kaggle platform](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/schmoyote/coffee-reviews-dataset?select=simplified_coffee.csv). In general, this dataset includes several attributes related to sales data and reviews of each coffee product, such as the coffee blend name, coffee roaster name, roast type, roaster location, origin of coffee beans, price, rating, and review. For more details, please refer to the 'simplified_coffee.csv' file available in this repository

1. Clone this repository: `git@github.com:teguhsukmanaa/Exploration-of-Coffee-Review-Data-Analysis.git`
2. Or download the file manually.

## Results
From this analysis project, it can be seen that every year, certain coffees consistently earn top ratings, usually scoring between 96 and 97. This suggests a reliable quality standard across different coffee types. We've also found that higher-priced coffees tend to receive better ratings, indicating that people are willing to pay more for quality. Additionally, we observe clear preferences for different roast levels, with some being more popular than others. For businesses, this means there's an opportunity to offer highly-rated coffees at reasonable prices, potentially boosting sales and keeping customers happy.
